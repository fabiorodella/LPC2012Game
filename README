This is the repository for the entry I'm hoping to submit to the Liberated Pixel Cup 2012 (http://lpc.opengameart.org/). For now, there's only a project for Xcode / Mac OS X, but I intend to also provide a MSVC project and a makefile and possibly another project format for Linux as soon as possible.
